Multi-Protocol Attack Vector Detector

I want you to create a comprehensive technical research report on a system that detects attack vectors not only over HTTP but also across multiple communication protocols.

Expected Features:
- **WebSockets (WS/WSS):** Detect XSS or data manipulation attempts through socket connections.
- **GraphQL:** Identify complexity attacks (query depth/complexity) and unauthorized data access attempts.
- **SQL Injection:** Detect classical SQL injection payloads.
- **HTTP Requests:** Analyze abnormal HTTP methods or header usage.

Technical Focus:
Protocols: WS/WSS, HTTP/1.1 & 2, GraphQL

Research Questions:
1. What are the fundamental working principles of these technologies/protocols?
2. What are the best practices and industry standards for securing them?
3. What similar open-source projects and competitors exist?
4. What are the critical configuration files and parameters to be aware of?
5. What are the key security considerations and pitfalls to watch out for?

Output Requirement:
Please provide your answers as a **detailed Markdown report** with **sources cited**.
